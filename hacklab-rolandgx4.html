  Roland GX24 Vinyl cutter instructions
  <br/>
  ===========================
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is a precision instrument worth well over 3kEUR, you *
  <b>
   will
  </b>
  * treat it with care and respect. You will *
  <b>
   start
  </b>
  * by reading the paper manual that came with the machine, then you *
  <b>
   will read*
  </b>
  the "Cutting Guide" found on the desktop of the Mac controlling the cutter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When done you will unload the material and replace the dustcover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everything else is covered in the fine manuals better than I could here, ask for hands-on instruction from someone who knows how to handle these machines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New rolls of material from Ebay are on shelf to the right. 12 inch (300 mm) * 5 ft (1.5 m). Correct cutting force seems to be 80-100 gf. This might vary between rolls.
