  Introduction to Arduino!
  <br/>
  Jody Culkin 2011
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A couple of notes
  <br/>
  This is the script for my Introduction to Arduino Comic. Each page is described in terms of the panels on that page. For each panel, there is a description of the drawing or visual content, any text in text balloons, text in the text panels at the bottom of the panels, and text labels that are in the drawing. I have indicated what text is in bold in word balloons and text panels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Probably the best way to check placement and font styles would be to compare with the original PDF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fonts:
  <br/>
  For most of the text in word balloons and text panels, I used LetterOMatic! 9 pt. I used LetterOMatic! 10 pt bold for text I wanted to emphasize in text panels, 9 pt in word balloons. Most text is black (#000000), highlighted text is sometimes red (#FF0000) or gray (#666666).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I included some of the font size and color information in the descriptions of the panels themselves if it is different from the standard 9 pt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For code, I used Monaco 10 pt with code formatted with the same colors as in the Arduino interface in the illustrator file (see my original PDF).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the last page, which has a lot of text, sub-heads are in 11 or 9 pt, links are 8 pt. In final panel, my info is 10 pt, thanks are 7 pt, Creative Commons license info is 6 point.
