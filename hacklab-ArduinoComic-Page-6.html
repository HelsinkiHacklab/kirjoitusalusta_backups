  PAGE 6 AC, DC, back to Arduino, USB, software
  <br/>
  Panel 21
  <br/>
  Drawing: Schematic with Direct Current and Alternating Current.
  <br/>
  Labels:
  <br/>
  Direct Current (DC)
  <br/>
  Alternating Current (AC)
  <br/>
  (In text panel): There are two common types of circuits, direct current and alternating current. In a DC circuit, the current always flows in one direction. In AC, the current flows in opposite directions in regular cycles. We will only talk about DC circuits here.

  Panel 22
  <br/>
  Drawing: close up of Arduino, character in profile with hand on cheek
  <br/>
  Word Balloon: Now that we’ve reviewed some basics of how electricity works, let’s get back to the Arduino.
  <br/>
  (In text panel): The Arduino will need power to run. We will need to attach it to a computer to program it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 23
  <br/>
  Drawing: Arduino, laptop, USB cable poised to connect them
  <br/>
  (In text panel): Attaching the Arduino to a computer with a USB cable will supply the power we need and allow us to start programming.
