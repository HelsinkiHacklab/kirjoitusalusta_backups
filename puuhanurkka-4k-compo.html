  <b>
   4k Wild Compo!
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   TLDR:
  </b>
  <br/>
  Submit an URL which contains your entry. The only requirement is, that it should work fullscreen in the latest version of Chrome. Rest is up to you. The entry is run on a
  <b>
   4k screen
  </b>
  and our jury will judge your demo with points from 0 to 10. (If you absolutely want, you can bring your own machine and run whatever code/effect/video you want)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Rules:
  </b>
  <br/>
  - The entry can be code (WebGL, canvas, HTML, CSS, etc...), a picture, a video... Pretty much anything that can be shown in the latest version of Chrome without any plugins.
  <i>
   If you bring your own computer, you can show about anything you like.
  </i>
  <br/>
  - The browser entries will be run on a pretty beefy machine, and shown on a
  <b>
   4k monitor
  </b>
  .
  <br/>
  - Submitting is done via email. The email address will be published later.
  <i>
   If you are going to bring your own computer, tell it to us.
  </i>
  <br/>
  - The compo is held at the Puuhanurkka stand, live, at a certain time. TBA.
  <br/>
  - Jury will give your demo points after it has been shown on monitor.
  <br/>
  - If the demo/video/whatever won't run, you CAN try to fix it so it can be shown after all entries, but if you cannot fix it before all the other entries have been run, you will be disqualified.
