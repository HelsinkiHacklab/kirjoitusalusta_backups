<body>Basic idea is to create <b>big</b> 7-segment displays using led-strip -modules like this <a href="http://dx.com/p/diy-5w-6000k-475-550lm-led-white-light-rectangle-strip-dc-12-14v-146071">http://dx.com/p/diy-5w-6000k-475-550lm-led-white-light-rectangle-strip-dc-12-14v-146071</a><br
/><br
/>Those will take pretty hefty transistors to drive them (it seems there are no large arrays available that can take ~5W per channel), discrete options:<br

><b>Control/driver board</b><br
/><br
/>The dirver/control board itself will have:<br
/><ul><li>shift-register</li
><li>the driver-transistors for 7 segments and the last bit can be wired for single led driven directly from the reg (dot)</li
><li>+/- connectors for the led strips</li
><li>LED Power +/GND connectors (in this case 12V)</li
><li>5V/GND connector for logic</li
><li>daisy-chaining connector for the shift-register, see for example: <a href="https://github.com/HelsinkiHacklab/reactor/blob/master/blueprints/shift_reg.brd">https://github.com/HelsinkiHacklab/reactor/blob/master/blueprints/shift_reg.brd</a></li
><li>Optionally it could also have an ATTIny to act as I2C interface to the shift-reg(s)<ul><li>Or even ATMega88, in that case we would have both TWI and SPI in hardware so we could drive a lot of shift-registers very fast (think PWM for brightness control)<br/><br

>Due to size reasons (see below) SMD components are preferred.<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>Physical assembly</b><br
/><br
/>Made on layers from lasercut acrylic (except maybe the bottommost layer needs to be some sort of metal so we can spread the heat from the led-strips around a bit [and it wouldn't hurt to be able to sink heat from the driver transistors as well])<br
/><br
/>Bottom: thin square the size of the display, this is where the led-strips and control board mounts to.<br
/>Layer1: Thick (basically determined by control-board thickness, though if it becomes too thick or othetwise a problem the board can be mounted elsewhere) opaque black acrylic square with cutouts for the led strips and the control board<br
/>Layer2: thin translucent but diffuse square of colored acrylic to give color to the digits and diffuse the led-strips<br
/>Top: thing opaque cover plate, square with cutouts for the segments.<br
/><br
/>All of these layers will have at least 3 holes to a side to keep them together with screws.<br
/><br
/>We can cut the acrylic at the Aalto Fablab (our own lasercutter won't handle pieces this big)<br
