<body><b>7x31 led matrix</b><br
/><br
/>Because that's what Styrge built, now we recycle the frame for something more usefull. It will be treated as 8x32 for simplified control, the last row&amp;column just do not actually do anything.<br
/><br
/><b>Phase 1: single color, no PWM</b><br
/><br
/>Call it proof-of-concept, will be wired with cheap-ass leds just to test the ideas we have.<br
/><br
/>Rows are handled by NPN-transistors, columns by shift-register boards originally designed for the infamour reactor simulator (each board has 4 595 regs and resistors for the leds so 32 bits per board). <a href="https://github.com/HelsinkiHacklab/reactor/blob/master/blueprints/shift_reg.brd">https://github.com/HelsinkiHacklab/reactor/blob/master/blueprints/shift_reg.brd</a><br
/><br
/>If zzorn manages to wire up all the leds so that the columns can just be connected with IDC-connectors to the shift-reg board I (rambo) can get rest of this working in couple of hours.<br
/><br
/><b>Phase 2: PWM:d RGB</b><br
/><br
/>The fun part...<br
/><br
/>Wired so that we have high-power (2A) PNP transistor feeding the Common-Anode of a row<br
/>and 3x4 shift-registers to sink the colors (again same board as above, resistor values as per color).<br
/><br
/>Driving this will be interesting, we'll be using XMegas and leverage the DMA, suovula and zzorn have some idea of how to keep calculating the bit-patterns for PWM in between the DMA pushing data to the shift-regs.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>This is not only quite insane amount of soldering quite challenging code-wise as well...<br
/><br
/>Bought 3 x 100 RGB leds from ebay, delivery 10-?? days&nbsp; --zzorn<br
