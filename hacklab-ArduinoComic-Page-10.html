  PAGE 10: Using a Breadboard, LED digital output
  <br/>
  Panel 37:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Hand holding breadboard
  <br/>
  (In text panel): How do we control objects that are not on the Arduino board? We will connect the Arduino to a solderless breadboard. This will allow us to quickly set up and test circuits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 38:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Close up of breadboard- text on white shapes with pointing arrows: (red type 10 pt bold)
  <br/>
  Labels:
  <br/>
  Holes connected horizontally
  <br/>
  Holes connected vertically
  <br/>
  (In text panel): This breadboard has 2 rows of holes running down the left and right side, and 5 rows of holes on either side of a middle indentation. The side rows are connected vertically, each row of 5 holes in the middle are connected horizontally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 39:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Power and ground connected from Arduino to breadboard and across top of board so power and ground run down both sides
  <br/>
  (In text panel): We will connect power and ground from the Arduino board to the vertically connected strips on the left and right with 22 gauge wire. Other components can be attached to the holes in the middle and to power and ground as needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 40:
  <br/>
  Drawing: LED.  Text defines anode and cathode
  <br/>
  Labels:
  <br/>
  Anode (connects to power)
  <br/>
  Cathode (connects to ground)
  <br/>
  (In text panel): When current flows through an LED (Light Emitting Diode) in the right direction, it lights up. We’ll attach an LED to the breadboard, then to the Arduino so we can control it with code.
