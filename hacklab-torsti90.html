   Tors s i90 is built Hacklab Mendel90 shaped 3D printer
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torsti90 is now tentatively configured, and can be found on GitHub:
  <a href="https://github.com/HelsinkiHacklab/Mendel90">
   https://github.com/HelsinkiHacklab/Mendel90
  </a>
  If there is enough new openscadi installed so clonen after openscad scad / main.scad open the 3D preview (take a bit of time to load). Index Torsti / contains the generated files, such as BOMit, drilling / cutting templates, as well as 3D - printed parts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That is now the default dimensions (20 0 × 20 0 × 20 0 m m printtausalue), and the material I put the time being 12  mm MDF (at least in the roof can then make a film plywood), smooth electrodes are 10  mm. I still do the ceiling, or an increase of filament - It comes as no coils held they should keep in mind before going to dissect discs, but the rest of them are not much affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The entire BOM: i can be found here:

  Suovula made quite an appropriate question that this is what replaces it with the original club's board already approved the idea of ​​purchasing a Makerbot kit and piled up so it should be consistent and also be transported in a printer - I would imagine that most of us aim is to print things and not nysvätä print blades?
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    I remember talk of the Board of Directors to acquire Mendel90 kit, at least in the meeting / discussion in which I was. Makerbot is expensive ($ 2200 + freight jenkeistä vs $ 800 incl mail Mendel90 whine) and closed-source, and can not sell any more crystals.
   </li>
   <li>
    This is suppose to replace it, I realized that you wish to use ramps electronics, for example, already-purchased, used smoothrodeja 8mm 10mm instead, etc. But if you want to buy a complete kit for so is suitable for eg my behalf, but I got a perception that the building would be of interest.
    <ul>
     <li>
      Let's probably then that will be continued this project, and the response rate at the next Board meeting if there is interest in addition to buying the kit (eg, if this project is to slow down).
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    In order to minimize the gruntwork a printer, the goal would be to follow the blueprints time carefully - for example, replacing parts in aluminum others are smaller and larger changes requires planning and slows down the project, as well as increasing the possibility that at some point you will notice that now the portions are no longer sovikkaan together.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  Another question: why MDF and aluminum, for example, which would certainly be more robust as a whole?
  <a href="http://reprapsource.com/en/show/6859">
   http://reprapsource.com/en/show/6859
  </a>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Aluminium processing is much more difficult, the aluminum is more expensive, is not clear what it should be. MDF has also been observed in practice enough to support.

    – labilla on nyt työstöhuoneessa iso sininen kannellinen laatikko jossa lukee TORSTI90 ja jonne sijoitin jo hankitun elektroniikan lisäksi parin kesken jääneen printteriprojektin (elmom, ferrix?) jäämistöjä. Mukana mm. laakeroidut kierretangot, pelkään vaan ettei niitä voida helposti käyttää tässä?  Joo, vaatisi liikaa uudelleendesignia vaihtaa kierretangot laakeroituihin, mennään perus rosterikierteellä + messinkimuttereilla.  Kierretangot ei kuitenkaan mendel90 designissä tarvitse tarkkuussijoittelua tjms, saavat liikkua ajon aikana (smooth rodit ja lineaarilaakerit pitävät akselit oikeilla raiteilla).

      Mjep, voi olla parempi, siinä tapauksessa vaihdetaan sopiviin koneruuveihin, esim uppokantaiset voisivat olla käteviä, saadaan pohja tasaiseksi.  Vastaavasti pitää vähän pidentää ruuveja jotta menevät läpi
