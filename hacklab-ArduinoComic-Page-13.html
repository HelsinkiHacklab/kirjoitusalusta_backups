  PAGE 13: Analog input. Potentiometer
  <br/>
  Panel 49:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Character head shot in front of gigantic potentiometer.
  <br/>
  Word Balloon: A potentiometer, or pot, is a variable resistor. The amount of resistance changes as it is turned, increasing or decreasing depending on which direction it is turned.
  <br/>
  (In text panel): Now we will set up an analog input. Weâ€™ll use a potentiometer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 50:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Breadboard with potentiometer attached to Arduino
  <br/>
  (In text panel): Attach the middle pin on the potentiometer to analog pin A0. Attach one end of the pot to power, the other to ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 51:
  <br/>
  Drawing: code for analog read serial output on white shape
  <br/>
  void setup() {
  <br/>
  Serial.begin(9600);
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  <br/>
  void loop() {
  <br/>
  Serial.println(analogRead(A0));
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  (In text panel): First we will look at the range of values we get by turning the pot using the serial monitor. In our code, we initialize the serial object in setup, setting a baud rate of 9600. In loop, we read the value from analog pin a0 and print it to the serial object using the printLn function.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 52:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Serial monitor window in Arduino software interface with numbers showing range of values. Arrows point to serial monitor button
  <br/>
  Labels:
  <br/>
  Click to open serial window
  <br/>
  (In text panel): After you have uploaded the script to the Arduino, click the serial monitor button in order to see the values as you turn the pot. A window will open, and you will see values ranging from 0 to 1023 as the pot is turned.
