  PAGE 12: Digital input: setting up a switch to turn LED on and off
  <br/>
  Panel 45:
  <br/>
  Drawing: hand holding switch
  <br/>
  (In text panel): Next we will add a switch, a digital input, so we can turn the LED off and on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 46:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Detail of switch attached to board along with LED and resistors
  <br/>
  (In text panel): Connect one end of a momentary switch to pin 4 on the
  <br/>
  Arduino, with a 10k resistor connected to ground attached to the same end. Attach the other end to power. We will leave the LED attached to the same pin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 47:
  <br/>
  Drawing: code for switch script written on white shape
  <br/>
  void setup() {
  <br/>
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
  <br/>
  pinMode(4, INPUT);
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  <br/>
  void loop() {
  <br/>
  if(digitalRead(4)){
  <br/>
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
  <br/>
  }else{
  <br/>
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  (In text panels): Next weâ€™ll write the code. In setup, we declare pin 2 an output and pin 4 an input. In loop, we use an if statement, if we read pin 4 as high, we set the LED pin to high, otherwise we set the LED pin to low, turning it off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 48:
  <br/>
  Drawing: split panel, finger pushing switch with LED lit, finger lets up and LED is off
  <br/>
  (In text panel) The LED lights when the switch is held down.
