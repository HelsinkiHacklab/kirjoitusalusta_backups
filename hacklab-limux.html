  A soda bottle vending machine we got from Nixu. "does not cool" was the diagnosis, Rambo&amp;Dist fixed this problem (the fan that was supposed to cool down the hot-side heat exchanged was completely stuck and the fan that was supposed to spread cool air on the cool-side was making horrible noises. Both are now fixed).

  More to follow.
