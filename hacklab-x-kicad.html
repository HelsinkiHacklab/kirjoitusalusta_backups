   0 printed circuit board manufacturing Workflow Thursday 9.7 at 18 from
  </b>
  <br/>
  The subject of the day is a circuit board manufacturing workflow, ie how ideas from the circuit board
  <br/>
  materialize.
  <br/>
  The course runs through the printed circuit board production workflow step by step from idea to manufacturing documents. Workflow covers both self-service and out preparation of the plates design.

   Circuit board design KiCADilla lauanataina 11.7 12-16
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The course focuses on printed circuit boards to draw an open-source program KiCADilla. The emphasis is on the use of the program and course work, practical work is done using a simple switching program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plotting of own components is to learn in this course, the components can be arranged at your own drawing its course if your interest is broader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The course runs through a simple wiring diagram and the circuit board suunnittely stages.
  <br/>
  1) Overview KiCADiin, the creation of a project, the project files. ~ 15 minutes
  <br/>
  2) Wiring Diagram program, circuit diagram design KiCADilla. ~ 60 minutes
  <br/>
  3) System assossionti ~ 15 minutes
  <br/>
  4) Pause, Q &amp; A ~ 30 minutes
  <br/>
  4) printed circuit board design software, printed circuit board drawing ~ 60 minutes
  <br/>
  5) Production files - Gerber - creation and revision of ~ 30 minutes
  <br/>
  6) Q &amp; A, ~ 30 minutes.
