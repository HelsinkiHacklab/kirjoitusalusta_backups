  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boot the device to bootloader, attach gdb and:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If attaching fails read below.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  monitor reset halt
  <br/>
  set {int}0xE0042004 = 7
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   <u>
    In case attach fails
   </u>
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Add to end of stm32f4x_stlink.cfg (usually found in /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  # reset and halt on gdb-attach
  <br/>
  $_TARGETNAME configure -event gdb-attach { reset halt }
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This forces target reset and halt on attach which prevents problems caused by the idle-sleep

   38.16.1 Debug support for low-power modes
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To enter low-power mode, the instruction WFI or WFE must be executed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MCU implements several low-power modes which can either deactivate the CPU clock or reduce the power of the CPU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The core does not allow FCLK or HCLK to be turned off during a debug session. As these are required for the debugger connection, during a debug, they must remain active. The MCU integrates special means to allow the user to debug software in low-power modes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For this, the debugger host must first set some debug configuration registers to change the low-power mode behavior:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - In Sleep mode, DBG_SLEEP bit of DBGMCU_CR register must be previously set by the debugger. This will feed HCLK with the same clock that is provided to FCLK (system clock previously configured by the software).
  <br/>
  - In Stop mode, the bit DBG_STOP must be previously set by the debugger. This will enable the internal RC oscillator clock to feed FCLK and HCLK in STOP mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   38.16.3 Debug MCU configuration register
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This register allows the configuration of the MCU under DEBUG. This concerns:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Low-power mode support
   </li>
   <li>
    Timer and watchdog counter support
   </li>
   <li>
    bxCAN communication support
   </li>
   <li>
    Trace pin assignment
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  This DBGMCU_CR is mapped on the External PPB bus at address 0xE0042004
  <br/>
  It is asynchronously reset by the PORESET (and not the system reset). It can be written by the debugger under system reset.
  <br/>
  If the debugger host does not support these features, it is still possible for the user software to write to these registers.
