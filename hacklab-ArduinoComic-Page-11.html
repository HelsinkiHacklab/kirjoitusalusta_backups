  PAGE 11: Digital output
  <br/>
  Panel 41:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Breadboard attached to Arduino with LED attached
  <br/>
  (In text panel): The anode is connected to pin 2 on the Arduino through a 220 ohm resistor. The cathode is connected to ground. Pins 2 through 13 can be configured as digital inputs or outputs. Click new button to start a sketch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 42:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Script on white shape
  <br/>
  void setup() {
  <br/>
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  void loop() {
  <br/>
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
  <br/>
  delay(500);
  <br/>
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  <br/>
  delay(500);
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  (In text panel): In setup, we set pin 2 to be an output. In loop, first we set pin 2 high which lights the led. Delay pauses 500 milliseconds, or half a second. When pin 2 is set low, the LED goes off, we pause another half second.

  Panel 43:
  <br/>
  Drawing: buttons on Arduino IDE interface. Text labels buttons with pointing arrows (red 10 pt type bold)
  <br/>
  Labels:
  <br/>
  Verify button
  <br/>
  Upload button
  <br/>
  (In text panel): Click verify on the menu to check your code. If there arenâ€™t any errors, click upload to put your program on the Arduino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 44:
  <br/>
  Drawing: 2 panels, LED glows on, LED off
  <br/>
  (In text panel): The LED blinks on for half a second, then blinks off for half a second, over and over again.
