  PAGE 9: writing scripts: setup and loop- brief overview of language
  <br/>
  Panel 33:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Blink script on white shape
  <br/>
  void setup() {
  <br/>
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  <br/>
  // Pin 13 has LED connected on most Arduino boards:
  <br/>
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  <br/>
  void loop() {
  <br/>
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // set the LED on
  <br/>
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  <br/>
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // set the LED off
  <br/>
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  (In text panel): A sketch, like a program written in any language, is a set of instructions for the computer. If we look closely at the Blink sketch, we see there are 2 major parts, setup and loop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 34:
  <br/>
  Drawing: fingers point to definitions of setup and loop on white shapes.
  <br/>
  Text (setup and loop in red type, definition in black all 10 pt.)
  <br/>
  Setup: happens one time when program starts to run
  <br/>
  Loop: repeats over and over again
  <br/>
  (In text panel): These are both blocks of code called functions that every sketch will have. They are blocked out by curly braces { }.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 35:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Back of character reading Arduino reference guide on laptop. URL (linked) on white shape
  <br/>
  Text (10 pt red type)
  <br/>
  <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage">
   http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage
  </a>
  <br/>
  (In text panel): Check out the Arduino website for the Arduino reference guide and many other resources to learn the language.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Panel 36:
  <br/>
  Drawing: Close up of blink script with explanation line by line with comments. Comments are in red in LetterOMatic
  <br/>
  Text
  <br/>
  void setup() {              //declares block of code
  <br/>
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);     //sets pin 13 to output
  <br/>
  }    //end block of code
  <br/>
  <br/>
  void loop() {        //declares block of code
  <br/>
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);     //sets pin 13 high
  <br/>
  delay(1000);         //pause 1 second
  <br/>
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);      //sets pin 13 low
  <br/>
  delay(1000);         //pause 1 second
  <br/>
  }    //end block of code
  <br/>
  (In text panel): For now, let’s look at this simple script line by line and see what each line does.
